This script can be used to create a local mirror of an existing 
GIT server that is using gitweb interface, such as http://git.kernel.org.

The script will first fecth the list of all projects on the server,
and then it will update the local mirror:
- adding new created trees
- removing trees that were deleted on the main server
- updating existing trees

Note: this is only working if the remote GIT server is using the gitweb 
interface, since it relies on the gitweb project list download link.

Improvements are much than welcome!

Example: ./git-mirror -o /var/www/git/ \
                      -s http://git.omapzoom.org \
                      -g git://git.omapzoom.org

This example will download all trees available on omapzoom git server.

Once the initial mirror is done, running this command again will only fetch
the changes.

Don't forget to use the '-n' option first to check what will be done by
the script.
