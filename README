This script can be used to create a local mirror of an existing 
GIT server that is using gitweb interface, such as http://git.kernel.org.

The script will first fecth the list of all projects on the server,
and then it will update the local mirror:
- adding new created trees
- removing trees that were deleted on the main server
- updating existing trees

Note: this is only working if the remote GIT server is using the gitweb 
interface, since it relies on the gitweb project list download link.

Improvements are much than welcome!
